# set 
# If we want to represent a group of unique elements then we can go
# for sets. Set cannot store duplicate elements. 
# 1. duplicates are not allowed 
'''set={1,2,3,4,5,5,3,2,1,9,6,7}
print(set)'''

# 2. order is not preserved
'''s = {10,20,30,40,50}
print(s)'''

# 3. objects are mutable
'''s= {10,20,'harsh',30,40}
s[2]='nayak'
print(s)
'''
# 4. indexing is not allowed 
'''s= {1,2,3,4,5}
print(s[3])'''

# 5. slicing ia not allowed
'''s={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
print(s[1:4:1])'''

# 6. represented is {} with comma seperated objects 
'''s={1,2,3,"harsh","nayak",4,5,6}
print(s)'''

# 7. hoomogeneous and hetrogeneous both are allowed 
'''s={1,2,3,"harsh","nayak",4,5,6}
