'''flow control means the order in which the statements
or instructions, that we write, get executed.'''
# three ways in which the statements will be executed.
# 1. Sequential
# 2. Conditional
# 3. Looping
'''Conditional: Statements are executed based on the condition. As shown above in
the flow graph, if the condition is true then one set of statements are executed, and
if false then the other set. Conditional statements are used much in complex
programs.'''
# (complex program)
# There are three types of conditional statements in python. They are as follows:
# 1. if statement
# 2. if-else statement
# 3. nested-if (if-elif-elif-else)
